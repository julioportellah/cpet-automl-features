**By:** Julio Portella

## Description

This repository contains the summarized code for the patient's limitations using CPET processed dataset

Order of execution

**1.** Execute the FeatureProcessor.ipynb
**2.** Run the BorutaFeatureSelection.Rmd
**3.** Filter manually the data using a jupyter notebook using the Boruta's selected feature
**4.** Use AutoML, the jupyter notebooks are a guide
**5.** Run the CPET_ModelAnalysis.ipynb to execute the models

## Important files

FatureProcessor generates the features, it is more organized than the original feature engineering notebook

CPET_ModelAnalysis has the loops and models

## Folders

The data folder contains the dataset
